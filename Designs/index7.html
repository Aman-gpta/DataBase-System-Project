      <p>
        This project addresses a critical need within educational institutions
        by introducing a user-friendly and intuitive database system that
        streamlines the process of scheduling and managing extra classes for
        teachers. Furthermore, the system will provide a platform for teachers
        to report and track classroom issues promptly, ensuring a conducive
        learning environment for students.To build a reliable and efficient
        system, this project requires proficient knowledge of database
        administration and programming languages such as SQL.
